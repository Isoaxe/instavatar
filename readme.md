# Instavatar

A program that harvests profile pictures from Instagram. The avatar is then stored in a Firebase storage bucket for future use. This is to reduce the amount of requests to the Instagram API as too many will result in the account being blocked.


## Getting started

In order to get started, create a Firebase account.
